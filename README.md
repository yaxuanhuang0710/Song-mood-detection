# Song-mood-detection

## Description
This project aims to utilize machine learning models to classify the song mood based on the lyrics. The model that performs best is ANN, achieving 87% accuracy. 

## Documents
1. code- data prepossess.ipynb is the data prepossessing stage, while model.ipynb is the model stage, containing six models
2. dataset-MoodyLyrics_raw.xlsx is the raw data, MoodyLyrics_final.csv is the prepossessed data
3. report-contains final report, final presentation slide and mid-check point report

## Highlights
1. Efficiently preprocess text data through advanced encoding techniques.
2. Perform a comprehensive comparison of classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Network.
3. Employ robust evaluation methods, such as classification reports and confusion matrices, to assess model performance accurately.
