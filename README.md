# Song-mood-detection

## Description
This project aims to utilize machine learning models to classify the song mood based on the lyrics, which hasn't finished yet. Our current progress is acheiving 81% accuracy using Gradient Boosting model. 

## Documents
1. DL_project_proposal.pdf- our current report, soon will be replaced by the final report
2. data_cleaning_LSTM.ipynb is the file containing data cleaning and three model(LogisticRegression model, biLSTM model, biLSTM+CNN model)

## Highlights
1. Preprocess text data efficiently using TF-IDF and tokenization.
2. Conduct a comprehensive comparison of classification models, including Logistic Regression, BiLSTM, CNN, BiLSTM+CNN, DistilBert, and GPT API Prompt models.
3. Address data imbalance through undersampling, downsizing the majority class to improve model performance.
4. Implement various techniques to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.
5. Fine-tune model parameters to optimize accuracy and enhance performance.
