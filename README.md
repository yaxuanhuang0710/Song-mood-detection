# Song-mood-detection

## Description
This project aims to utilize machine learning models to classify the song mood based on the lyrics, which hasn't finished yet. Our current progress is acheiving 81% accuracy using Gradient Boosting model. 

## Documents
1. Mid Check point report.pdf- our current report
2. Dataset-MoodyLyrics_raw.xlsx is the raw data, MoodyLyrics_final.csv is the prepossessed data
3. Code-data prepossess.ipynb is the data prepossessing stage, while model.ipynb is the model stage

## Highlights
1. Efficiently preprocess text data through advanced encoding techniques.
2. Perform a comprehensive comparison of classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Network.
3. Employ robust evaluation methods, such as classification reports and confusion matrices, to assess model performance accurately.
